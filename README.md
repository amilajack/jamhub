# FAQ

- What is that?
  > jamhub is a [server](https://github.com/fletcherist/jamhub/blob/master/jamhub.go) implements midi-over-websocket protocol and web application with high-quality virtual instruments, drum loops and textures.
- My ping is high
  > Use wi-fi, not mobile internet. If it doesn't help, you can easily host your own jamhub server on your vm. Create issue and I'll let you through the process. If you can't host your own server, feel free to create issue and I'll host an instance in your region.
- Can I attach MIDI keyboard?
  > Yes, you definitely can, so give it a try
